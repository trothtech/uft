¢|SF EXEC¢%

 Use SF to send files to other users on this or any NJE or Internet
 connected computer.   Theoretically, SF will get the file you send
 to the intended user even without TCP/IP or RSCS connectivity
 as long as you can send mail to that user.

 where:

 fn ft fm
         is the fileid of the file(s) you wish to send

 user
         is the user to whom you wish to send this file

 host
         is either an NJE-connected host or an IP-connected host.
         SF tells the difference by whether or not the hostname
         is dotted. Internet (IP) hostnames are dotted.

 Options:

 NETDATA
         causes SF to use NETDATA format to retain the file's
         record structure.   This is the default.

 ASCII
         causes SF to canonicalize the file as plain text,
         which on the Internet is represented as lines of ASCII
         terminated with carriage-return and linefeed

 BINARY
         causes SF to canonicalize the file as a byte stream

 Usage Notes:

         This version of SENDFILE does not support the
         FILELIST or ACK options.

         With this version of SENDFILE, the TYPE option has a
         different meaning than for the standard IBM SENDFILE.
         You normally should not need to specify explicit TYPEs
         because the ASCII, BINARY, and NETDATA options cover
         the most commonly encountered cases.

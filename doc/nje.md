# NJE

NJE stands for "Network Job Entry" and is a well established protocol
for sending files and interactive messages. UFT provides the same service
but is an open protocol.

NJE is an IBM invention.

There are several solutions available to enable NJE networking
on Unix and Unix-like systems such as Linux. UFT exists to simplify
topology and interconnect. In plain English, you don't have to run
an NJE server or daemon on your Linux systems to use UFT. You can
send files with only the UFT client. (If you need to receive files
then of course you do need the server.)

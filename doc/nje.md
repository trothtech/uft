# NJE

NJE stands for "Network Job Entry" and is a well established protocol
for sending files and interactive messages. UFT provides the same service
but is an open protocol.

NJE is an IBM invention.

There are several solutions available to enable NJE networking on Unix
and Unix-like systems such as Linux. UFT exists to simplify topology and
interconnect (and to avoid using proprietary protocols where that matters).
In plain English, you don't have to run an NJE server or daemon on your
Linux systems to use UFT. You can send files with only the UFT client.
(If you need to receive files then of course you do need the server.)

## Network Job Entry

Wikipedia has a thorough description of IBM NJE in the context of
systems and software which use it.

You may notice that NJE is related to RJE "Remote Job Entry".
Discussion of RJE is out of scope for this project,
but it may provide historical perspective of the development of NJE.
